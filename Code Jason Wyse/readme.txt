The experiments may be run by simply changing your current working directory to the Evidence folder and typing either

source("RunRadiataPine.R")

to run the Radiata pine experiment or

source("RunPima.R")

to run the Pima Indians experiment.

Modifications to the number of iterations and tempering scales etc. can be made by the user by checking the function arguments in the ModelEvidence*.R files. Modifications to the prior assumptions may be made by changing the arguments to the evidence.obj function when called from RunRadiataPine.R or RunPima.R
